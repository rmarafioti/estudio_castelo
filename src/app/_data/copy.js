      "If you're looking for a tattoo artist you can trust, Felipe is the one. His studio is spotless, his attitude is grounded and welcoming, and his tattoos are nothing short of outstanding. No heavy hands here! As a woman getting large-scale work done on my back, stomach, ect. feeling safe, comfortable, and respected was always important to me. Felipe creates an environment where that's never in question. His professionalism, integrity, and respect for all his clients shines through in everything he does. He's the real deal, an artist who truly cares about both the art and the person wearing it.",

      "Felipe is amazing! I've gone to him for coverups, touch-ups, and new tattoos, and his work always blows me away. His realistic nature designs are beautiful, and his thorn work is next level. He's humble, easy to work with, super professional, and incredibly gentle. Couldn't recommend him more!",

      "Felipe is one of the most talented and professional tattoo artists among the Chicago tattoo scene! I have 6 large pieces from him, and every single one was done with such care and precision. He has an incredible bedside manner and genuinely cares about all of his clients to make sure they feel safe and comfortable during each session. 4 of my 6 pieces were all freehanded and have always been beyond impressed with his skill. I am always looking forward to my next Felipe De Sousa piece!",
